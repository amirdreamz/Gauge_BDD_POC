# Gauge_BDD_POC


What is the Gauge Test Automation Framework?
Gauge is a test automation solution that's being built by ThoughtWorks; it's cross platform and open-source. It supports multiple languages including Ruby, Java, C#, Python and Javascript, and it has upcoming support for other languages — like Golang — as well.

Gauge also works with Selenium Webdriver

Q.Why should i use gauge instead of Cucumer or Jbehave framework ?
A. Gauge not only offers plugins for Java, but for a bunch of other languages you can check out on the Gauge Plugins page.    Even cooler is that if you don’t see a plugin that meets your needs you can simply create your own using the Gauge Plugin API.

Gauge is CI-Ready
With Gauge, you don't necessarily have to run your test specifications from an IDE like IntelliJ because it also has a first-class command line support that allows you to integrate it with a continuous integration system like Jenkins.
